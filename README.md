# Extraction Process of DICOMS
This python script can extract your dicom files and then seperate the data and the image from the dicom files. As the meta data from the dicom files can be similar in one single study, that's why only one data file will be saved here.

## Installation
1. create `virtual-env` folder and install your virtualenv for the project.
2. installation process `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup
1. paste your dicoms in the `orders/` folder.
2. run the script by `python parser.py`
